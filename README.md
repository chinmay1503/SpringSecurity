# SpringSecurity

A Basic Spring Security Project that helps one to understand and learn the concepts of Spring Security, Also the configuration in this Spring Project is based on Java configuration Instead of the XML configuration. 

The project was intended for solely educational purpose. Feel free to refer. Credits to all the people for the resources that I have utilized in this project.
